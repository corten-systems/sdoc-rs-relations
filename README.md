Parse Rust source trees for [StrictDoc](https://strictdoc.readthedocs.io/) `@relation` markers to yield JSON source code spans.

If you're looking for the `sdoc-rs-relation-html` Python package, see [`demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html`](demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html).

TODO

## Example Output

Example `HTML` output is in the [`demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html/examples/html`](demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html/examples/html) directory. If you're viewing the repository in a web browser, you will need to **download** or **clone** those files to your local computer to view them.

Those demo HTML files were generated by running the [`demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html`](demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html) utility.

## Upcoming Changes

The Python package `sdoc-rs-relation-html` will be deprecated in favor of a new Rust binary, of the same name, in this crate. The new binary will be a re-implementation of the Python CLI too, in Rust.

The reason for the rewrite is that the Python package uses [`Pygments`](https://pygments.org) to highlight the source code, using a [custom lexer](https://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/) for each language.

The new binary uses [`autumnus`](https://github.com/leandrocp/autumnus) for syntax highlighting, which uses [`tree-sitter`](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for parsing.

The ongoing rewrite work is on the [`html` branch](https://github.com/corten-systems/sdoc-rs-relations/tree/html), if you want to check it out.
