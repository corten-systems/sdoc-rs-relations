## Example Output

Example `HTML` output is in the [`demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html/examples/html`](demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html/examples/html) directory. If you're viewing the repository in a web browser, you will need to **download** or **clone** those files to your local computer to view them.

Thost demo HTML files were generated by running the [`demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html`](demo/sdoc-rs-relation-html) utility.
